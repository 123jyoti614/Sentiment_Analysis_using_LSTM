# Sentiment_Analysis_using_LSTM
This project focuses on classifying movie reviews as positive or negative using deep learning. It leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to capture long-term dependencies in natural language.
# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

This project aims to classify movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** using an LSTM-based deep learning model. The model is trained on the IMDb dataset and is capable of capturing long-term dependencies in text to accurately predict sentiment.
